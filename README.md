# cordova-apps

##pimatic-apk
pimatic-apk is a copy and android modified version of pimatic-app by sweebee (Wiebe Nieuwenhuis). See readme inside that folder.

##pimatic-viewer
pimatic-viewer is not a cordova application but an [appinventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) application whichI created some 1Â½ year ago. The apk can be installed on your android phone/tablet.
The `pimatic-viewer.aia` is the source code which you can import into appinventor.<br><br>
As a matter of fact you can also use it to create "bookmarks" to other websites.
